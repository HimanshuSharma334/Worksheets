Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly
	Que:11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary
	Answer:
	
	List: A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements.
	Lists are just like dynamic sized arrays.A single list may contain DataTypes like Integers, Strings, as well as Objects. 
	Lists are mutable, and hence, they can be altered even after their creation.
	The list is a datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.
	List are mutable .i.e it can be converted into another datatype and can store any data element in it.
	List can store any type of element.

# Python program to explain 
# List 
	
# Creating a List 
List = [] 
print("Blank List: ") 
print(List) 
	
# Creating a List of numbers 
List = [10, 20, 14] 
print("\nList of numbers: ") 
print(List) 
	
# Creating a List of strings and accessing 
# using index 
List = ["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"] 
print("\nList Items: ") 
print(List[0]) 
print(List[2])

	Tuple:Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list. The sequence of values stored in a tuple can be of any type, 
	and they are indexed by integers. Values of a tuple are syntactically separated by ‚Äòcommas‚Äô. Although it is not necessary, 
	it is more common to define a tuple by closing the sequence of values in parentheses.
	Tuple is a immutable sequence in python.
	It cannot be changed or replaced since it is immutable.
	It is defined under parenthesis().
	Tuples can store any type of element.
# Creating an empty Tuple 
Tuple1 = () 
print("Initial empty Tuple: ") 
print (Tuple1) 
	
# Creating a Tuple with 
# the use of list 
list1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6] 
print("\nTuple using List: ") 
print(tuple(list1)) 
	
#Creating a Tuple 
#with the use of built-in function 
Tuple1 = tuple('Geeks') 
print("\nTuple with the use of function: ") 
print(Tuple1)

	Set:Set is an unordered collection of data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. 
	The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for checking whether a specific element is contained in the set. 
	Sets are unoreder collection of elements or unintended collection of items In python.
	Here the order in which the elements are added into the set is not fixed, it can change frequently.
	It is defined under curly braces{}
	Sets are immutable.i.e it cannot be changed or replaced.
# Python program to demonstrate 
# Set in Python 
	
# Creating a Set 
set1 = set() 
print("Intial blank Set: ") 
print(set1) 
	
# Creating a Set with 
# the use of Constructor 
# (Using object to Store String) 
String = 'GeeksForGeeks'
set1 = set(String) 
print("\nSet with the use of an Object: " ) 
print(set1) 
	
# Creating a Set with 
# the use of a List 
set1 = set(["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"]) 
print("\nSet with the use of List: ") 
print(set1)

	Dictionary: Dictionary is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike 
	other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. 
	Key value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.
	A Dictionary can be created by placing sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‚Äòcomma‚Äô.
	Dictionary holds a pair of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding pair element being its Key:value.
	Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated, whereas keys can‚Äôt be repeated and must be immutable.
	Dictionary keys are case sensitive, same name but different cases of Key will be treated distinctly.
# Creating a Dictionary 
# with Integer Keys 
Dict = {1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'} 
print("\nDictionary with the use of Integer Keys: ") 
print(Dict) 

# Creating a Dictionary 
# with Mixed keys 
Dict = {'Name': 'Geeks', 1: [1, 2, 3, 4]} 
print("\nDictionary with the use of Mixed Keys: ") 
print(Dict) 

	Que:12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string ‚ÄúI+Love+Python‚Äù, write a small code to replace ‚Äò+‚Äô
	with space in python.
	Answer:The string data types are immutable. Which means a string value cannot be updated.
	#Suppose a string 'I+Love+Python'which store in var. 
	var = 'I+Love+Python'
	var.replace('+',' ')

	Que:13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting
	the datatype of a variable in python 
	Answer:The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character.
 	If the string length is more then one, and a TypeError will be raised.

# inbuilt function return an 
# integer representing the Unicode code 
value = ord("A") 

# writing in ' ' gives the same result 
value1 = ord('A') 

# prints the unicode value 
print value, value1 


	We use the type() function to find the type of any variable in python.
	For Example-
			var=19
		        type(var)
		Output:int
	
Q14 and Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook File as 'Solution.ipynb'
	Que:14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form ùëéùë•2 + ùëèùë• + ùëê = 0. Where a, b and c are to
	be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‚Äòa‚Äô should not be equal to 0.
	Answer:See the solution file name as'Solution.ipynb'.
